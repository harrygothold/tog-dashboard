## Introduction

This is technical test for The Office Group. It's a dashboard application built using NextJS, TypeScript, CSS modules and Jest/react-testing-library for unit testing.

There is a hosted version of this project on Vercel [https://tog-dashboard-452h.vercel.app/](https://tog-dashboard-452h.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

First, to install the dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install (you might need the --legacy-peer-deps flag as this project uses React 19 and has some conflicts with some package versions)
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Testing
